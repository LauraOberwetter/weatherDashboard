# 06 Weather Dashboard

## This Program

This is a simple weather application that allows users to look up basic weather information of any US city. Users can either search for a city in the search box, or they can click on a city that has already been searched and has been populated in their search history list. The search yeilds inforamtion about the tempreature, humidity, windspeed, UV index of the targeted city, and provides a 5-day forecast. The UV index of the searched city will change color to indicate the level of harm associated with the UV levels at that time.
